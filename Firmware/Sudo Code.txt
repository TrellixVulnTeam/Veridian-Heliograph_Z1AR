Configuration:
- BLE, Connectable with DFU and Waypoint set. Data download?
Advertising with Stop 2(2)
(Tx = 0 dBm; Period 1.28 s; 31 bytes, 3 channels)
- ADC Read 3 channels into DMA, software trigger
- RTC clocking LSE 15S interrupt
- LPUART 9600 Baud
- LIS3DH 10Hz 8 Bit XY axis.
- SPI 1MHz DMA
- GPS 1HZ super-e, Software backup mode

loop:
Trigger Analog read 1Hz
Process GPS
Update Display (check LIS3DH orientation)
Set next power state, calculate power rate
Wait for ADC & Display
